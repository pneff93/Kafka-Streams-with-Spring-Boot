# Kafka Streams with Spring Boot

This project serves as a playground for me learning Spring Boot and its components.
I focussed on the following things:
* creating a RestController to send data via HTML form
* producing and consuming data with Kafka Streams
* using Avro schema
* adding a HealthRoute
* testing functions

## Initialize project

https://start.spring.io/
* Spring Web
* Spring for Apache Kafka Streams
* Spring for Apache Kafka
* Thymeleaf

## Run project

```./gradlew bootRun```
